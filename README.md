# Flashcard Webapp
This is the client-side of my flashcard application. Check out the complete demo [here.](http://tripham.flashcardwebapp.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

### Getting started ###

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
	> git clone https://github.com/trihpham/flashcard-webapp.git
	> cd flashcard-webapp
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

Note*: You need to also install and run my flashcard-webapp-server repository for the backend
